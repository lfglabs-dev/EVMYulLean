/-! # Running to a stop condition, and basic blocks

`EvmYul.EVM.Proof.Execution` peels `X` one instruction at a time. Neither it nor
the raw semantics can yet talk about a *block*: a maximal straight-line stretch
of code, which is the unit a correspondence proof actually wants to reason
about.

This file supplies that layer.

* `Halting` classifies the instructions after which `X` stops, and proves the
  classification is a property of the opcode alone — `H` reads the machine state
  only to fetch the returned bytes, never to decide whether to stop.
* `Z_ok_state` is the frame theorem for `X`'s exceptional-halting check: when `Z`
  accepts, the state it hands to `step` is the pre-state with the memory
  expansion charged and *nothing else touched*. This is what lets a block-level
  statement be phrased against the state `X` decoded the instruction in, instead
  of against `Z`'s otherwise invisible output.
* `RunUntil` composes consecutive non-halting iterations of `X` until a named
  stop condition fires or the fuel is spent, and `xRunUntil` is the executable
  driver, validated against it in both directions.
* `XReaches` is the trace-erased form the block tactics work in, and `x_step` /
  `x_block` discharge a short straight-line block from step facts in the
  context.

Everything here rests on `EvmYul.EVM.Proof.Execution` alone. No axiom is
introduced and no proof is admitted.

/-! ## Halting is a property of the opcode

`X` consults `H` after every instruction to decide whether to stop. `H` takes a
machine state, but only ever to read `H_return` out of it on the branch that has
already decided to halt. `Halting` is the same decision without the machine
state, and `H_eq_none_iff` is the proof that nothing was lost. -/

nested tests so that the equivalence below is a case split and not a search. -/

/-! ## `Z` is a gas frame

`Z` is `X`'s exceptional-halting check. It is written as a long chain of guards
around a single state update, and the update is the memory-expansion charge. So
whenever `Z` accepts, everything a block-level statement wants to observe —
storage, memory, logs, the stack, the program counter — is unchanged.

Without this theorem every block lemma would have to be phrased against `Z`'s
output, which is a state no caller can name. -/

/-- The state `Z` hands to `step` once it has accepted: the pre-state with this
instruction's memory expansion charged. Naming it is what lets every lemma below
be phrased against `pre` alone. -/
def zMid (pre : State) (w : Operation .EVM) : State :=
  { pre with gasAvailable := pre.gasAvailable - UInt256.ofNat (memoryExpansionCost pre w) }

/-- A guard in `Z` that did not fire may be dropped. `Z`'s body is a chain of
these, so peeling with this lemma walks the chain one guard at a time. `simp`
cannot do it: `Z`'s unfolded body is large enough to exhaust the simp step
budget, and `split_ifs` re-elaborates every branch. -/

/-! ## Inverting a step

A block-level proof needs to go from "a step happened" to "here is where it
landed". `XStepAt.post_eq_of_step` is that inversion, and it is generic — the
caller supplies the step equation for the opcode at hand and gets the post-state
pinned, with `Z`'s output already eliminated by `Z_ok_state`. -/

/-- `step` has no fuel-free case, so a step that succeeded had fuel to spend.
This is what lets an inversion use `fuel + 1` step equations at a fuel that is
only a variable. -/

/-! ## Running to a stop condition

`XRuns` chains non-halting iterations of `X`, but says nothing about *why* the
chain ended: any prefix of a run is a run. `RunUntil` closes that gap. It ends
only for a reason it records — the decoded opcode satisfies the stop condition,
or the fuel is gone — so `RunUntil.stopped` can hand a correspondence proof the
fact that the continuation begins at a block boundary.

The trace is still an index, so everything `XRuns` proves about fuel accounting
carries over through `RunUntil.toXRuns`. -/

/-- `X` runs from `pre` to `post`, taking only instructions that neither halt nor
satisfy `stop`, and ending as soon as one does — or when the fuel runs out. -/

/-! ## The executable driver

`RunUntil` is a relation, so nothing about it can be *computed*. `xRunUntil`
walks the same block and returns the trace it took. It is validated in both
directions: `xRunUntil_sound` says its answer is a `RunUntil`, and
`xRunUntil_complete` says it finds every `RunUntil` there is. A caller may
therefore discharge a concrete block by evaluation and still hold a proof.

The driver never inspects a post-state to decide whether to continue, which is
exactly what `Halting` being a property of the opcode buys: the decision is made
before the instruction runs, and `H_eq_none_of_not_halting` supplies the
non-halting side condition afterwards. -/

/-- Walk a block: run non-halting, non-stopping instructions until the stop
condition fires or the fuel is spent, returning the trace, the fuel left, and
the exit state. -/

/-! ## Trace-erased runs

A straight-line block is usually reasoned about without naming the trace: what
matters is that `X` gets from here to there, and how much fuel it spent.
`XReaches` is `XRuns` with the trace existentially quantified. It is the form the
tactics below work in, because it has no index a tactic would have to invent. -/

/-! ### Chaining blocks across a boundary

A `RunUntil` cannot be extended: it has already stopped. What a control-flow
proof actually chains is *block, boundary instruction, next block*. At the
trace-erased level that composition is available, and it is the statement that
lets a whole path through a control-flow graph collapse to its endpoints. -/

block: the result reaches the far end. -/

/-! ## Automation

`x_step` peels one instruction off an `XReaches` goal by finding the matching
`XStepAt` fact in the context; `x_block` peels the whole block and closes with
reflexivity. Between them a short straight-line stretch is discharged without
the caller naming a single intermediate state. `x_collapse` carries that through
to an `X` goal, replacing the entry state by the exit state.

The gas cost and the intermediate state are left as named holes rather than
inferred, because at the moment a step is peeled neither is yet determined: both
are fixed by the hypothesis `assumption` finds.

The tactics are deliberately small: they search the local context and nothing
else, so they cannot silently invent a step that was never proved. -/

/-- Peel one non-halting `X` step off an `XReaches` goal, taking the step from a
hypothesis. Fails when no hypothesis matches, which is what lets `x_block` stop. -/

  `(tactic| (refine XReaches.head (gasCost := ?gas) (mid := ?mid) ?step ?rest
             case step => assumption))

/-- Discharge a straight-line block: peel steps while the context supplies them,
then close by reflexivity. -/
macro "x_block" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| ((repeat x_step); exact XReaches.refl ..))

/-! ## Non-vacuity

`RunUntil`, `XReaches` and the tactics are all exercised below on real steps, so
none of the theorems above is proved about an empty relation. `JUMPDEST` is the
cheapest instruction `X` continues through, and `EvmYul.EVM.Proof.Execution`
already supplies its step, so these witnesses do not depend on evaluating a
concrete machine state. -/
