/-! # Observations and frames

A correspondence proof between two executions never needs the whole post-state:
it needs to know *what an instruction can be observed to change*, and — far more
often — what it cannot. This file supplies both halves for the instructions whose
effects are localized: `SSTORE`, `MSTORE`, `MSTORE8`, `LOG0`–`LOG4`, `RETURN` and
`REVERT`.

The pattern throughout is a pair of theorems per instruction:

* a *step equation*, computing `EvmYul.EVM.step` on a state whose stack is
  explicitly `μ₀ :: μ₁ :: rest`, and
* *frame theorems*, reading each observation off that equation — the one
  component that moves, and the components that do not.

The step equations are stated for a state written `{ pre with stack := … }`
rather than for an arbitrary `pre` constrained by `pre.stack = …`. That is not
cosmetic: with the stack a literal, the `popₙ` in the operation's implementation
reduces, and the whole equation is closed by `rfl`. With the stack behind a
hypothesis it does not reduce, and the proof has to fight `X`'s `CREATE`/`CALL`
branches.

`Storage` is `Std.TreeMap UInt256 UInt256 compare`, but `UInt256`'s derived `Ord`
carries no lawfulness instances, so none of the `Std.TreeMap` lookup lemmas
applies to it. Everything below rests on these four instances; without them no
statement about a single storage key can be proved at all. -/

`Account.updateStorage` is not a plain insert: writing zero *erases* the key, so
that the account's storage stays in the canonical form the state root is computed
from. Both branches are key-local, and both agree with `lookupStorage` at the key
written, which is what makes the distinction invisible to an observer. -/

frame theorem is proved once for a whole family of instructions rather than
once per opcode. -/

into `{ pre with stack := … }` first. -/
